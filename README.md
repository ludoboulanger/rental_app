# Welcome to Rentix

#### The app that helps people to share things together
Rentix is a web app that allows you to make money by sharing 
stuff that you only use often to other people around you. 

You have a pair of ski but only have the time to go to the mountain once a week? 
List it on Rentix and get some money while you're making someone happy to try this sport.

You need a circular saw to do some work on your house? Find one on Rentix and pay less that you would in a hardware store.
